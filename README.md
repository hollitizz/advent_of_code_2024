# Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨  

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, written in Rust.  

## Goals  
- **Learn Rust:** Improve my understanding of Rust by solving real-world-like problems.  
- **Write Clean Code:** Practice structuring and documenting code effectively.  
- **Have Fun:** Enjoy the puzzles and the spirit of the season!  

## Getting Started  
To follow along or run the solutions on your machine, youâ€™ll need Rust installed. Get it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).  

### Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/advent-of-code-2024-rust.git
cd advent-of-code-2024-rust
```

### Repository Structure  
Each day of Advent of Code has its own Rust project. The repository is structured as follows:  

```  
advent-of-code-2024/  
  â”œâ”€â”€ day01/         # Project for Day 1  
  â”œâ”€â”€ day02/         # Project for Day 2  
  â”œâ”€â”€ day03/         # Project for Day 3  
  â””â”€â”€ ...            # And so on  
```

### Running a Day's Solution  
Navigate to the corresponding folder and use `cargo` to run the solution. For example, for Day 1:  

```bash  
cd day01  
cargo run  
```
